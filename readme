Project for the Intelligent Systems course at University of Pisa.
Aim of the project is to build systems that recognize movement around a door, distinguishing between entering, exiting or passing by.
The data provided has been recorded using RFID tags, one mobile on the person and one static on the wall.

The systems are based on different technologies:
- Pattern recognition with neural networks
- Mamdani fuzzy classifier
- Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System
- Clustering with self-organizing maps
